```
# 3) RetroArch

#### Turn ON SWAP partition:

Use swapfile to prevent DragonBoard from running out of RAM. Follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/96boards/documentation/blob/master/ConsumerEdition/guides/sd_swapspace.md) for allocating swap space in SD card.

## 3.1 Emulator Installation

#### Clone the Emulator source

```shell
$ git clone git://github.com/libretro/RetroArch.git
```
#### Building and Installing the Emulator

```shell
$ cd RetroArch
$ ./configure
$ make -j 2
$ sudo make install
```
## 3.2 Core Installation

#### Clone the core source

All of the supported cores for RetroArch is available [here](https://github.com/libretro/). You can use any of them. For instance, follow the below instructions to clone and build ***snes*** core.

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/libretro/snes9x2010.git
```
#### Building the core

```shell
$ cd snes9x2010 
$ make -f Makefile.libretro
```
After building, the core ***snes9x2010_libretro.so*** will get generated

## 3.3 Game Execution

Run the Emulator with compiled core and ROM.

```shell
retroarch -L snes9x2010_libretro.so <path_to_rom>
```
> Note: Replace <path_to_rom> with the path of appropriate ROM. Instructions for downloading ROM is not provided here.

#### Building the source

```shell
$ cd RetroPie-Setup
```
This script will install emulation station, RetroArch and few cores.

```shell
